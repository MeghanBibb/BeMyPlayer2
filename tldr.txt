Information expert has the account and graphics controller

graphics controller gets passed teh account and sets that to its on member 
and populates that with variables from the various mvc.
graphics controller also has the only jframe we should have. pass it to each mvc so we can easily switch between screens without having a million pop ups

each model has data for the view ie buttons and text fields we might want to
access data from later

each controller has a model and a panel with action listeners
for the view

each view adds stuff to the panel ie buttons
